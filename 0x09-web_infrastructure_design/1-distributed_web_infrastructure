For every additional element, why you are adding it?
-The second server serves as a replica of the first one in order to ensure continuous applicatrion availability.
-The Load Balancer (HAproxy) is used to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers.

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works?
-Round Robin algorithm distributes requests evenly to each server in a circular manner.

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both?
-The load balancer enables an Active-Active setup.
-Active-Active setup ensures the distribution of of incoming requests across multiple servers and all servers actively handle requests.
-Whereas, the Active-Passive setup ensures only one server actively serves traffic as the "active" server while the others are on standby as the "passive" servers.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works?
-The Primary(Master) database server is responsible for all data processing, read and write operations, data modification and maintenance.
-The Replica(Slave) database server replicates data from the primary server, and serve as standby database servers.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application?
-The Primary node serves as the authoritative source for handling write and data modification operations, data consistency and retrieval.
-The Replica node is used for read options to offload the primary node and improve performance without affecting the primary node's performance.

Where are SPOF?
-The Load Balancer

Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)?
-No firewalls designed to protect the web applications, servers and networks from unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other security threats.
-There are also no HTTP Secure protocols at this level to secure the connection

No monitoring?
No monitoring system to ensure the tracking of the performance of both the application and database servers.
