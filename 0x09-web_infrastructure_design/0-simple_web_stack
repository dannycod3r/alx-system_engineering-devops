- Issues of Simple Web Stack Architechture

This system does not have a reduntant server thus is when this server is down, 
the website can not be accessed. The server is a Single Point Of Failure(SPOF).

When there is any update on the code, the web server has to be restarted for changes to replect.

In this architechture, too much traffic can not be handled thus this system is often slow and can not scale
